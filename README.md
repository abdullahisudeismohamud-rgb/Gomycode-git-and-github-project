# Learn Git – Version Control Fundamentals

This repository documents a structured Git practice exercise completed as part of the **GOMYCODE Git & GitHub** curriculum.  
It demonstrates core version control operations including repository initialization, file tracking, commit management, file removal, history inspection, and global Git configuration.  
The repository also includes **screenshots** as supporting evidence of command execution and results.
